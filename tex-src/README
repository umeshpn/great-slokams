This gives the instructions of how to update great-slokams.pdf and great-slokams.html.

Disclaimer: This was built on a Macbook Pro machine running macOS
version 11.4 (Big Sur) using MacTeX-2021 Distribution for LaTeX/XeTeX.
It may not work as it is in other platforms and may need minor modifications.

You need:

1) A working LaTeX/XeTeX system.

2) A python3 compiler.

3) The fonts Gayathri, Manjari and Rachana (available at
   https://smc.org.in/fonts/).  You may use other Malayalam fonts as
   well, if you make corresponding changes in the file
   great-slokams.tex.

The files you obtain from Github that do not need much change are the
following:

1) scripts/SlokamGenerator.py and scripts/indexkeygenerator.py: The Python programs
   used to generate necessary intermediate .tex files.  You don't need
   to make any changes to these scripts.

2) tex-src/great-slokams.tex: The main .tex file.  You don't need to change
   anything in this file, unless you want to add/change sections or
   change various configuration paramaters.

3) tex-src/meter-decl.tex: List of names of vruththams.  You don't need to
   change anything here, unless you want to add a new vruththam.  If
   you need to add a new vruththam, follow the conventions in the file
   and add the definition.

4) tex-src/people.tex: This is a list of people quoted in the document.  When
   you introduce a new author or other people, it is recommended to
   add it here, and use the macro name in the document.  This is for
   consistency in spelling and to have unique index entries.

5) tex-src/malayalam.ist: Definition for the index format.

The files you get from Github, which you need to modify to add more
slokams in Malayalam unicode are:

1) great-slokams-san.tex: Add Sanskrit slokams in the alphabetic order
   here.

2) great-slokams-mal.tex: Add Malayalam or Manipravaalam slokams in
   the alphabetic order here.

To add a slokam, identify its position in the alphabetical order, and insert it like:

\begin{slokam}{<1>}{<2>}{<3>}
<Slokam line 1> \\
<Slokam line 2> \\
<Slokam line 3> \\
<Slokam line 4>
\end{slokam}

\Letter{<5>}{<6>}


Here,

<1>: The vruththam of the slokam.  Use the macro name in
     meter-decl.tex.  If it is a new vruththam, add it in
     meter-decl.tex, and use the macro here.

<2>: The name of the poet.  The poets name can be directly given here,
     but it is recommended to use the macro from people.tex, adding an
     entry there to refer a new poet.

<3>: The first part of the slokam.  This will appear in the indexes.
     It is also used as the label to refer it from other places.


Slokam line <1-4>: The four lines of the slokam, the first three
    terminated with \\.  If you want to break lines in the middle of a
    line, add a \\ there.

\Letter{<5>}{<6>}: Enter the starting letter as <5> and the next
letter (The first letter of the third line) as <6>.  This is required,
and will not be printed in the document. This information is used to
prepare statistics and index.

Optionally, the following also may be added after the slokam:

\Book{<7>}: The name of the book.  It will be printed in the text and
will be included in the indexes.

\Topic{<8>}: The theme of the slokam.  You can add multiple topics for
    the same slokam. It wil be printed in the text and will appear in
    the indexes.

Any arbitrary text as commentary.  There, you may refer other slokams
using the label <3> of that slokam.  The following ways of referring
are there.


\OSlRef{<9>}:  Reference to any arbitrary slokam.

\PrevSlokaRef{<10>}: A suggestion of reciting this slokam after <10> in
    aksharaslokam.  They may be of similar structure.

\NextSlokaRef{<11>}: A suggestion of reciting <11>  after this slokam in
    aksharaslokam.  They may be of similar structure.

\OSlRef{<12>}:  If this slokam is a translation, <12> gives it original slokam.

If the slokam you are adding is for a new letter not already in the
document, add the following lines just before the slokam.

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{<13>}
\befin{enumerate}

where <13> is the new letter.

The new files can be generated as follows:

1) Change directory to the "tex-src" directory.

2)  Run '../Slokgenerator.py'.  This will generate the following files.

    a) great-slokams-mal-tex.tex
    b) great-slokams-san-tex.tex
    c) stats.tex
    d) slokam-count.tex
    d) great-slokams.html

  Do not check in these files to the repository.  They will be generated every time.

2) Compile the XeTeX files by

  a) xelatex great-slokams

     Repeat it till there are no more warnings with the following text:

     "LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right."


  This will create a number of files (*.aux, *.out, *.toc, *.log,
  *.idx, *.ind, *.ilg, *.pdf).  Do not check in any of them.


Take the following files as output:

1) great-slokams.pdf:  Slokams in PDF format.
2) great-slokams.html: Slokams in Unicode HTML format.
